# JSL Interpreter Project Potential Upgrade

**Document Purpose:** This document outlines the phased technical roadmap for evolving the current static hiragana gesture recognizer into a comprehensive, real-time Japanese Sign Language (JSL) interpreter. It is designed for a developer with a background in software engineering, detailing the necessary architectural and conceptual shifts.

## The Core Challenge: From Static Poses to Dynamic Language

The most significant evolution is the shift from **Image Classification** (identifying a single hand pose) to **Sequence Processing** (understanding a series of movements, gestures, and their context over time to form a sentence). This is not an incremental update but a fundamental change to the entire data and modeling pipeline.

## Phase 1: Handling Dynamic Gestures (The Foundational Change)

The immediate goal is to enable the recognition of single signs that involve motion. This phase replaces the core components of the current system to handle time-series data.

#### 1. Big Change: Data Collection and Structure

* **From Images to Sequences:** The data collection process must be modified to capture *sequences* of frames for each gesture instead of individual images. A single data sample will be a short recording (e.g., 30-40 frames) of a sign being performed.
* **New Data Format:** The `data.pickle` file will change from storing a list of 1D arrays (`num_features`) to a list of 2D arrays (`sequence_length`, `num_features`).

#### 2. Big Change: Model Architecture

* **Switch to Deep Learning:** The project must adopt a deep learning framework like **TensorFlow (Keras)** or **PyTorch**. The `RandomForestClassifier` is not suitable for sequential data.
* **Adopt a Sequence Model:** The classifier will be replaced with a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, specifically an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network. LSTMs are designed to recognize patterns in sequences by maintaining an internal state or "memory."
    

#### 3. Big Change: Inference Logic

* **Implement a Frame Buffer:** The inference script must maintain a temporary buffer (e.g., a `deque` of fixed size) that stores the landmark data for the last `N` frames.
* **Predict on the Buffer:** A prediction is made only when the buffer is full by feeding the entire sequence into the LSTM model. This creates a "sliding window" for real-time recognition.

## Phase 2: Scaling for a Larger Vocabulary

With the foundation for dynamic gestures in place, this phase focuses on expanding the system's knowledge and robustness.

#### 1. Big Change: Comprehensive Data & Feature Expansion

* **Massive Data Collection:** The vocabulary must be expanded to hundreds of words, requiring a significantly larger and more diverse dataset (multiple signers, lighting conditions, etc.).
* **Track Both Hands and More:** Many JSL signs use two hands, facial expressions, and body posture. The feature extraction should be upgraded from MediaPipe `Hands` to **MediaPipe `Holistic`**. This tracks landmarks for both hands, the face, and body pose, providing a much richer input for the model.
    

#### 2. Big Change: Adding a "Null" or "Idle" Class

* **Preventing False Positives:** To create a stable interpreter, the model must learn when *not* to make a prediction. A "null" class, containing data of hands at rest or in non-sign-related motion, must be added to the training set.

---

## Phase 3: From Sign Recognition to Language Interpretation

This final phase tackles the challenge of translating a continuous stream of signs into coherent sentences, moving from computer vision to the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

#### 1. Big Change: Adopting a Translation Model

* **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Architecture:** The task is no longer classification but *translation*. This requires a **Sequence-to-Sequence** model, often built with LSTMs or, more modernly, a **Transformer** architecture.
* **The Model's Task:** The model will take a long sequence of landmark data (representing multiple signs) and output a sequence of Japanese words.

#### 2. Big Change: The Need for a Parallel Corpus

* **The Data Challenge:** Training a translation model requires a **parallel corpus**â€”a large dataset of sign language videos that are meticulously aligned with their time-stamped text translations. Acquiring or creating this data is a major undertaking.

#### 3. Big Change: Handling JSL Grammar

* **Beyond Word-for-Word:** JSL has its own grammatical structure. A sophisticated translation model learns these patterns from the parallel corpus, enabling it to generate natural-sounding sentences instead of a direct, literal translation.
